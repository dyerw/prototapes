Prototapes
==========


The idea behind prototapes is that while their are currently mixtape websites, none allow
users to interact privately with their friends using an intuitive interface, allow for personalization
users would expect from traditional CD mixtapes (notes on songs, etc.), or allow the uploading of 
personal music files with support for tag correction and identification of filetype and bitrate.


Currently a work in progress, so far the backend REST API is complete and tested.


The next item to begin work on is the front end. I'd like to use Backbone to create
a single page application


to install, simply run: python steup.py develop
